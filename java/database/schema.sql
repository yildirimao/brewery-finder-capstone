    'Mantra is a big, bold, pastry stout. An array of specialty grains bring together a complex malt profile of caramel, milk chocolate, toffee, and a touch of coffee. Minimal hops bring just the right amount of bitterness. We brewed and fermented it to leave enough sugars behind to create a robust and creamy mouthfeel. Each release sees Mantra conditioned on a different set of adjuncts that bring to life some of your favorite dessert flavors. This variant of Mantra sees extended aging on freshly toasted coconut and delicious cacao nibs. The result sees this complex sweet stout get more intense with big tropical flavors, delicate nutty sweetness, and slightly bitter dark chocolate.',
